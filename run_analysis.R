# I personally prefer lowercase, so we apply tolower to the labels also

# from the project description there's certain ambiguity, but looks like the most
# plausible interpretation is to keep those columns refereing to mean/stdev, and

# using grep. Don't forget to get also "activity" and "subject" columns, we need

# we are told to use descriptive variable names, so I've decided to apply some
# transformations; basically: I prefer "." to "-" (and "_") for separators in
# variable names names. Also, I prefer always lowercase. A t or f at the beginning
# of the variable name is quite cryptic, so I've decided to use "time" or "freq"
# (for frequency; I believe frequency is too long ad freq is quite explanatory).
# Also, expand other abbreviations (Acc -> acceleration)
# Finally, use "stdev" instead of "std" for standard deviation. Personal preference.
